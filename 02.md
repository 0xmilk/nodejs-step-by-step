## Introduction

Hi guys. Well it's been a little while since our last session, and I do appologize for such a long hiatus, but I'm back now and I'm looking forward to continuing this series on node development.

This session will be sort of a hodgepodge of different topics that I think will be of good use to anyone who is considering making Node a regular staple of their development tool belt.

We've got a bit of a taste for node after our first two sessions, and now I want to go off on a bit of a tangent and dive into some of the infrastructure that's grown up around node to help make developing in it much easier. Today will be all about learning some of the tools and concepts that will, hopefully, make you much more effective and will also aid you in the completion of this series.

So, considering that it's been such a long break since our last session, and, in the interim, Node has advanced from release 0.4.5 to 0.6.10, I think a good topic to start off with would be the Node Version Manager, or nvm as it's typically referred to. As the name suggests, nvm will allow you to install and switch between several different versions of Node. Coupled with another excellent tool for managing package installations called npm, you can create virtual environments around specific versions of both node and third party libraries making development much easier, especially considering the volatility of the node world.

After exploring these two pieces of software, we'll put them to use by creating our own virtual environment for the development of our blog system. We'll install a couple of third party packages to this environment, one of which will help make our development go a bit faster, and the other will give us the ability to use templates when defining our views. Before finishing this "hands on" portion of our screencast, I'll go over one more very handy tool for development---the debugger---which, though not terribly full-featured and a bit clumsy at times, it will, nonetheless, be an absolutely invaluable addition to your development arsenal.

Finally, before we end this session, I've received a few requests to explain how node works, specifically, what makes it different from more traditional thread-based systems. I'm going to run through an explanation that I hope will be both intuitive and enlightening. Node is a great tool, but it's meant for a very specific purpose, and like all things, it has advantages in certain situations and disadvantages in others. It's my hope that, armed with a deeper understanding of what node does that makes it such a great tool in certain circumstances, you'll be better equipped for deciding when to use, as well as, when not to use node for your development.

So, apologies made and summary out of the way, let's get right down to
business.

## Node Version Manager (nvm)

Node is still at an early stage in its development, having not yet reached a 1.0 release as of this date, and so it's current stable version is constantly being updated. You'll see this same issue pop up in the third party libraries and frameworks that you'll be using in your development as well. To manage this constantly changing state of affairs, we need a way to manage multiple versions of Node as well as multiple versions of the packages that we'll be using. That's where this episode in our series comes in handy.

Today, we'll be taking a look at two very useful tools for managing our development environment. The first is nvm which we'll use now to install and manage a couple of versions of node. So, let's go ahead and get that installed and see what all it has to offer.

### Installation

To install nvm, just go to its github site in your browser (you can do so by simply googling nvm and, most likely, it will be one of the first few results---if not the first). The installation is quite simple, it's basically a matter of storing the nvm directory somewhere in your filesystem and then sourcing the main shell script whenever you start a new shell. So, if you have git installed on your computer, you can copy this line here [copy the install line from the website] and run it at the command line. what this will do is checkout the nvm repository into a hidden directory named .nvm in your home directory. If you don't have git installed, one option would be to install it (honestly git is a great piece of software to have), but another option that's a bit faster is just to scroll back up a bit and click on the Downloads link here and then choose whether you want to download the repository as a zip file or a tarball. Once you've got that download, you'll need to unzip or untar it and then change its name and location to .nvm in your home directory.

Next, we'll need to add little bit of code to our shell's config file, such as your .bashrc file, to make the environment aware of nvm. Let's go ahead and open that up now. So, here I'm going to pull up my .bashrc file---you'll need to place the following somewhere within this file:

	if [[ -f $HOME/.nvm/nvm.sh ]]; then
		source $HOME/.nvm/nvm.sh
	fi

So, what this does is whenever you start a new shell session, it will check for the existence of the nvm.sh file within the .nvm directory that you just created. If it exists, it will run the file within the current shell creating several new shell functions for you to use. Now, you don't actually need to surround the `source` command with the check for the file's existence since we know it's there, but I like to have it there to keep the shell from screaming at me whenever I remove or move my .nvm directory for whatever reason. One more thing to notice, is that you can actually name your nvm directory whatever you want and keep it whereever you like, you'll just have to change the bit of code above to reflect your preferences. So, feel free to move the nvm folder around to somewhere else if having a hidden directory in your home directory is not to your liking.

Ok, now that we've got nvm installed, you just need to source your startup file to get nvm to be recognized in the current shell. To make sure everything worked properly, call nvm now and hopefully what you see is the help output for the command.

If you just saw some help information fly across your screen, you're all setup and ready to manage multiple versions of node.

### Exploring nvm

Now that you have nvm installed, let's play around with it a bit and see what all it has to offer and then install the latest version of node to our system using nvm.

## DRY'ing up the code

Now, the code that we've created so far is not the prettiest, and it
certainly is not the DRYist. You can already see a few problems with
what we've created so far. First, as we add more routes, the number of
functions that we need to create for each begins to grow rapidly and
just coming up with unique names to identify each one can become quite
a task. Next, the `if` statement that are creating to figure out which
route goes to which function may be alright for a single route or two,
but quickly becomes a mess of spaghetti code in no time so we'll need
to revamp the way that we do dispatching at some point. Third, the
view that we've created is just a simple HTML file. What happens once
we need some of the elements in the view to be dynamic? Finally,
loading all of our views at the very begining of our app's life seems
just plain silly. For one, if we have a view that is rarely seen by
the user, then it's just taking up space and making startup take
longer for no good reason if the chance of it being seen is very
small. Another reason why this could cause problems is what happens if
we find a mistake in our view's markup? Right now we'd have to restart
our server just to make a small change to the markup and that doesn't
sound like a very good idea. So, you see, we've come a long way, but
we've still got quite a long journey ahead before I would even
consider running this piece of code in production.

So, we've identified some problem areas and we want to do a little
refactoring to our code to make it a bit more maintainable. Of the
items we just identified the ones that we are going to tackle first
are the latter two dealing with the way we load our views. What we
really want here is some type of templating system and lucky for us,
the Node ecosystem happens to have a few that we can take advantage
of. For our app we are going to use a templating system called
[Jade][jade], but before we can use it, we've got to install it and
for that we need to learn a bit about an app called npm.

### Introducing npm

Node has a package management system similar to systems for other
languages such as CPAN, PyPI, and Gems. This package manager, as I
already mentioned, is called [npm][npm] which, of course, stands for
the Node Package Manager. It's dead easy to install and use, so we are
going to install it now and use it to install Jade to our system. To
Install npm, go to its website and copy the line that begins with curl
underneath the "One Line Install" header and paste it into your
command line. This will download a simple installation Shell script
and run it to install npm. So, let's do that now.

Once you've got npm installed, test it out by running `npm -v` to
print the currently installed version, which as of this screencast is
version 1.0.3, so you should see something along those lines appear on
the screen.

### npm Basics

npm has several useful commands that you can see by simply running
`npm` from the command line without any arguments, like so. You should
know that you can get a simple manpage for any of these commands by
running `npm help command-name` or you can also get a short summary of
what the command does by calling `npm command-name -h`. Let's try that
out with a couple commands now.

First, we'll take a look at the `list` command. We can see here that
the `list` command essentially shows us what packages we have
installed on our system. Let's try it out now. Hmm, `(empty)`, not
very interesting. Let's try to find our Jade package and get it
installed then. Let's check out the search command. Just type `npm
help search`, ah, now that sounds more like it. The search command
will search the registry of available packages and let us know what
all it finds. Let's try that out now and search for Jade. There we go,
the fourth result down from the top is the Jade template
engine. That's exactly what we're looking for, so let's install that
now.

To install Jade, you simply need to run the `npm install jade`
command, but before we do let's talk a bit about the two different
types of installs that you can do with npm. When npm made the jump to
1.0, it added a new way to do things. In the past, when you called the
install command, the specified package would be installed into a
global location available to all of your Node apps. With the 1.0
release however, the default is to install the package locally with
the option to specify a `-g` switch which will turn on global
installs. The rule of thumb here is that if the package you want to
install is a simple library, you should probably install it
locally. Doing so means that you have all of your apps dependencies
neatly stored within the app's main directory, so deployment is simply
a matter of copying the main directory over to your server. On the
other hand, if the package comes with global functionality, such as
scripts that you can run to perform actions, such as we'll see in a
bit with Jade, then you may want to install it globally so that
functionality is available to you at all times. Jade, as we'll see is
both, it is a library for us to use in our apps, but also a command
line program for turning Jade template files into HTML from the
command line. In this special case, it is recommended to install the
package both globally and locally and that is what we are going to do
now.

Let's start by installing globally by calling `npm install jade
-g`. Now, if we call `npm ls` we should see the newly installed
package in our list. Well, what's this, the command still says
(empty). Hmm, well what if we also tack the `-g` flag onto the end of
the list command like so. Ah, now we see that Jade has indeed been
installed to our system. Remember that anytime you want to see or do
anything globally with npm, you must use the `-g` flag, otherwise,
you'll be doing everything from the current directory. Before we
install Jade locally, I want to point out one more thing here. Notice
too that npm is also in our list of installed packages. That is
because npm can also manage itself as well, so now when new updates of
npm are available, rather than going through the installation proces
again, you can simply update npm like you would any other package---by
calling `npm update npm`. Nice, huh? Finally, one other little thing
I'd like to point out is that the list command is showing us a tree
structure rather than a list of installed packages. The reason for
this is to show the dependencies that packages have on others. So,
while Jade has no dependencies, according to the output of the `npm
list` command, npm itself has four packages that were installed as
dependencies for it.

#### Test Jade out with the jade command line script

Since we've installed Jade globally we will have access to a script
that comes with Jade that can be used translate our Jade files into
HTML. Let's try that out now just to get a taste of what Jade can
do. Flip over to the Jade website and copy the sample Jade file that
shows up on the homepage. Then create a new file called
`test.jade`. You can create it anywhere you like since this is only
for test purposes. I'm going to create mine in the `/tmp` folder. Once
you've got the file created, you can run the `jade` script against it
by calling `jade test.jade` from the command line. Hmm, so that seems
to have caused some problems though. Let's take a look and see what
the issue is. It looks as if a variable within the template called
`pageTitle` is undefined. So, let's take a look at the help for the
script and see if there are any options we can use to define the
variables. To do that call `jade --help`, and from the looks of it the
very first option, `-o` will allow us to pass in a JavaScript object
as a string to define all of the variables within the file. Let's try
that now. From the command line let's call `jade test.jade -o
"{pageTitle: 'Hello World'}"`. Well now, that still didn't seem to
work. The reason for this is that the options object for Jade has
several high-level attributes that can be defined, one of which is the
`locals` attribute which is another object of local variables that can
be accessed within the template file. So, if we make our object the
`locals` attribute of the object we're passing into the jade command,
it should work. And, it looks like that resolved our issue, but now we
see that there's another variable we are missing. From the output of
the script and the name of the variable, I'm going to guess that it is
a boolean value and set it to true in our options object. This time we
see the message "compiled test.html" so we can be assured that we were
able to process the Jade file properly. Let's open the file that was
created and take a look at the output. It's slightly messy, so let me
just clean that up for you. There, that's better. Now if we compare
this file to the one on the website we'll see that they are for all
intents and purposes identical. This script can be pretty useful in
many scenarios. When developing your application, it can be nice to
have a script like this to see the actual HTML output. Since the
script can be set to watch files for changes and recompile them
accordingly it can also be used to create static websites as well. For
our project though, we want to use it in our application and so, for
that reason, we are also going to install it locally so that we can
simply copy our app's directory over to the server for it to work.

#### Install jade locally (talk about the node-modules directory)

To install locally, make sure that you are in the top level directory
of your app---in our case, this is the `blog` directory---and call the
`npm install jade` command again, though this time without the `-g`
option. Once finished, you should see a new directory called
`node-modules` in the root directory of the app.

the `node-modules` directory is a convention of Node's. Whenever you
call the require function in a node app and pass in a string that does
specify a native module of Node's, or a relative path to a module
file, Node will begin looking for the module's file. It will do so by
starting with the current directory and looking for the file in the
`node-modules` directory within it. If it does not find the file
there, it will move up a directory and look within the `node-modules`
directory there. It will continue to do this until it either finds the
file or reaches the root of the directory tree.

Now that we've got Jade installed, we can create our actual view. I'm
not going to go over the specifics of Jade in this set of screencasts
simply because there's not much to it. If you already have experience
with HTML, then it'll only take about an hour tops to get well enough
acquainted with Jade to be effective. If you have any experience with
HAML, you'll find yourself very comfortable using Jade. For our
purposes, however, we are going to take what we have already and use
another tool to convert that into Jade markup. The name of that tool
is html2jade and I'm going to install it globally since it is just a
simple command line script and not a library that we need to include
with our app. If you plan on using Jade again in the future, it is a
good tool to have and very helpful when learning Jade. Nevertheless,
If you prefer, you can install your copy locally, you'll just have to
remember that the script will not be available globally. Instead,
you'll need to give the relative path to the script which will be
found in the `bin` directory of the html2jade directory inside of the
local `node-modules` directory. Let's go ahead and install that
now. Now let's run that and pass in the name of our HTML file. That
should create a new file for us in the same directory as the HTML file
with the name of the original file, but with the `.jade` extension.

Let's open that up now and just take look real quick. As you can see
it's quite a bit less verbose than normal HTML. In addition, where
HTML uses opening and closing tags to indicate hierarchy, Jade, like
Python, uses whitespace. This give Jade a very clean feel compared to
HTML.

Now that we've generated our view in Jade, let's flip back over to the
Jade website and see how to use it in our app. If you scroll down the
page just a bit, you'll run into a section called Public API. This
short section describes how to use the library within your application
to render Jade templates. It's very simple, just require the Jade
module and call the `renderFile` method. Flip back over to your
`app.js` file and add a require command to the top of the file to
require the Jade module. Then let's skip down to the
`renderNewPostForm` function and replace this code with a call to
Jade's `renderFile` method instead. Then, we can safely remove the
call to read the original HTML file. Finally, since we are no longer
reading anything from the file system, we can also remove the
statement to require the `fs` module. Go ahead and save that and then
jump out of their back to our main application directory. Since we are
no longer using the `new.html` file, we can safely remove it as well
now. Now, for the real test, let's run our app again and make sure
that we didn't break anything after this last round of changes. And,
there we go, looks like we migrated our app over to using the Jade
templating language without breaking a single thing. Congratulations!

## Wrap Up

Well, that pretty much brings us to the of this episode. We've covered
quite a lot of ground today. We started off this screencast with a
simple web server that served a single line of text, "Hello World" and
we've ended with our first route serving an HTML form derived from a
whitespace significant templating library. Along the way, we've
learned a bit more about Node and quite a bit about the Node packaging
tool npm. We've used npm to install our first third party library and
incorporated that library into our application. When you think about
it, that's quite a significant amount of work. Add to that the fact
that your application is not an add on to a web server, but an entire
web server in and of itself and it is truly remarkable that we are
still only at about 30 lines of code. Not too bad for a days work.

In our next episode, we'll learn a bit about CommonJS, a project whose
goal is to aid in the building of an ecosystem for JavaScript outside
of the browser. We'll learn how to create our own modules following
the CommonJS spec. And we'll create our very first module to aid us in
the development of the remaining routes for our application.

It should be fun, so I hope you'll all join me again for the next
episode. See you soon.
